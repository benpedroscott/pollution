      <p class="text-first"><a class="dropcap">C</a>ancer Alley is a region in the south of Louisiana that has one of the highest rates of cancer in the nation. These cases are due, at least in part, to the massive number of chemical factories surrounding towns, all of which are fairly poor, most of which are predominately African American.</p>
      <p>These chemical companies release chemical such as polystyrene into the air, water and land as waste in order to create products like styrofoam. The state of Louisiana provides tax incentives for companies to build such factories, claiming that these factories will drive up the economy of Louisiana.</p>
      <p>However, again these efforts to prop up the state’s economy on industry comes at the expense of Louisianians living in towns surrounded by factories. These 'factory' towns often don’t have much of their population employed in those factories. Ownership claims that prospective employees must have proper certifications, which townsfolk often lack.</p>
      <p>One town, St. Gabriel, has over 30 chemical factories in a 10-mile radius. These factories often surpass the EPA’s recommend guidelines for the amount of toxic waste a factory should expel for certain chemicals.</p>
      <p>Local media have consistently reported that the state’s governing body over industrial regulations, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, has not been properly policing the companies regarding pollution.</p>
      <p>The department has been victim to budget cuts and insufficient resources over the years, especially during former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s administration. This has resulted in a reduced number of employees, a high workload for every employee and frequent employee turnover.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with ProPublica, the Times-Picayune also reported the following:</p>
      <p>“The auditor’s report found that the time it took for the LDEQ to issue enforcement actions after a known violation more than doubled between fiscal year 2015 and 2019, from nearly 10 months to nearly 20 months.”</p>
      <p>“Auditors also found it could take as long as nine years from the time a company was cited for violating emission standards before it was ordered to pay a fine or was required by a settlement to pay for a mitigation project.”</p>
      <p>Air quality has certainly improved since the 1980s. However, that increase in quality must be compared across other states in the country, almost all of which have seen much more drastic increases in quality of air when compared to Louisiana’s increase.</p>

      <p class="text-first"> Louisiana ranks bottom in life expectancy in the U.S. The general trend across the country shows that states in the southeastern U.S. have the lowest life expectancy. Notably, a good portion of those states also share a border alongside the Mississippi River, as well.</p>
      <iframe title="Average life expectancy in U.S. by state" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Ng9oL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ng9oL/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 40%; min-width: % !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: flex;" height="531"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</script>
      <p class="text-first">Louisiana's life expectancy by parish also provides some interesting takeaways. While there is no direct smoking gun, it still shows that Louisiana is fairly consistent across the board regarding life expectancy, save for outliers that have wealthier populations, like St. Tammany Parish, or parishes with tiny populations, like Tensas Parish. However, it is important to note that parish demographics can vary from city to city.

      <p>The Clean Air Act, the Clear Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act are all seminal pieces of environmental legislation that Louisiana fails to enforce. Louisiana has also seen a high number of violations against the Clean Drinking Water Act, as well, which is caused by sorely lacking water systems across parishes in the state.</p>
      <p>“This is due to a lack of resources, natural disasters and a culture in which the state agency is expected to protect industry – according to the inspector general of the EPA,” one Times-Picayune article wrote about the DEQ.</p>
      <p>Since the EPA has investigated the DEQ, the agency has increased the amount of inspections and visits it pays to facilities. However, toxic emissions from certain plants still soar beyond recommended EPA limits.</p>
      <p>The Denka plant in LaPlace still releases 2.5 to 17 times the recommended limit for the chemical chloroprene, which is used to create the rubber compound known as neoprene. The EPA considers chloroprene to likely be carcinogenic to humans. It has been found to specifically increase the risk for live cancer.</p>
      <p>The Union Carbide Plant in St. Charles Parish also emits a high level of ethylene oxide, which is used to create anti-freeze and is also found to be likely carcinogenic to humans.</p>
